# Text-to-image-Synthesis-for-Fashion-Design
With the aim to study the respective impacts of **network architectures** and **training data** on the performance of text-to-image synthesis, two GAN-based algorithms are adopted, namely, Attentional Generative Network ([AttnGAN](https://github.com/taoxugit/AttnGAN)) and Stacked Generative Network ([StackGAN](https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN)). They are applied on two fashion datasets separately, i.e., [FashionGen](https://www.fashion-gen.com/) and [Fashion Synthesis](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/FashionSynthesis.html).
